Add another “I Agree with the terms and conditions” checkbox to the WooCommerce checkout page.

== Description ==
This plugin will be most helpful for e-Commerce stores in Europe as many countries in the union require the cancellation or GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) policy to be displayed as a separate checkbox and agree by the customer before placing the order.

You can optionally link a page that contains your additional terms and conditions. For example, you may want to include a cancellation policy and ask customers to agree to it before placing the order. 

If the checkbox is not checked and the customer attempts to place an order, an alert box will be shown that prevents them from moving forward.

The plugin setup is minimal and requires no knowledge of HTML or CSS. It could not be simpler.

== Installation ==
= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 7.2 or greater.
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater or MariaDB version 10.0 or greater.
* WordPress version 5.0 or greater.
* WooCommerce version 3.4 or greater.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option — WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”
 
In the search field type “Woo Additional Terms”, then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found the plugin, you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Click “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation "Manual plugin installation").

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.
